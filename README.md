# DiscoSpotipy
Spotify Rich Presence for Discord made written in Python.

## Quick Notes
* If you get redirected to a "This site canâ€™t be reached" page just copy and paste the url into the console.
* You might ask `Why is my status named "music on spotify" instead of just "Spoitfy"?`, because discord is screwing with the presence and won't show for everyone else if the name is "Spotify".

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* `aiohttp` and `spotipy` libraries
* `psutil` for windows users
